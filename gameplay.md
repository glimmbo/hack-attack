#Hack-Attack Gameplay#

##Overview##
Hack-Attack is a mobile, browser-based, geolocational game. Players compete by going out and attempting to 'hack' each other or objectives placed on the map. It is a game of assymmetrical information, so locating your target(s) is half the battle. The proximal nature of gameplay encourages social interaction while playing, but can be played in total anonymity if preffered.


##Initiating Play##
Games are initiated by any player in 'lobby' fashion. The host sets rules for the game, including number of players, duration, play area, and cooldown timers etc.


##Game Modes##

###Bounty###
Free for all. Each player in the game is assigned a target. The objective is to locate and hack your target. If successful, your target is eliminated and you are re-assigned your victim's target. Last hacker standing wins. If there is a time limit to the match, the player with the most amount of bounties collected wins.

###Base###
Two or more teams. Each team has a hidden base. The objective is to locate and hack all other teams' bases. Last base standing wins.


##Actions##
These actions are available across all game modes. The cooldowns/limits of each can be set at the creation of the game.

###Hack###
The primary weapon of a hacker.

###Scan###
Reveals any players in a 500m radius. Cooldown (x)minutes.

__Base Scan__
In Base mode, the base will have its own scanner with a separate cooldown. Any player on the team can activate it from a distance.

###Dragnet###
Deploy a line on the map by placing two points. Any player that walks through it is revealed for (x) amount of time and is unable to hack. Each player has a limited amount of 'net' that can be deployed at any one time. Once triggered, the net is removed, and the cooldown for that amount of net starts.
